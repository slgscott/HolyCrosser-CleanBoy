# Deployment Troubleshooting Guide - Version 2.8.5

## Current Status
- ✅ Development build: Working perfectly
- ✅ Production build: Compiles successfully
- ✅ Production runtime: Starts correctly on port 3001
- ✅ Harbor database: Connects successfully in production
- ✅ Health check: Returns healthy status
- ❌ Deployment platform: Unable to reach deployed version

## Verified Components
1. **Build Process**: `npm run build` completes successfully
2. **Production Server**: Starts without errors
3. **Database Connection**: Harbor DB connects in production environment
4. **API Endpoints**: Health check responds correctly
5. **Static Assets**: Generated and bundled properly

## Deployment Configuration
- Target: `autoscale`
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Start command: `npm run start`
- Port: Dynamic (PORT environment variable)
- Environment: Production ready

## Potential Issues
1. **Platform-specific**: Replit deployment infrastructure issue
2. **Network configuration**: External access blocked
3. **Environment variables**: Missing in deployment environment
4. **Resource allocation**: Insufficient resources for autoscale

## Recommendations
1. Try manual deployment trigger
2. Check deployment logs in Replit dashboard
3. Verify custom domain configuration
4. Test with different deployment target if available

## Version History
- 2.8.4: Had local database dependency causing hangs
- 2.8.5: Removed local database, simplified architecture
- Current: Production build verified working locally
