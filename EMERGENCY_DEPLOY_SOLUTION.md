# Emergency Deploy Solution - No Configuration Files

The builds keep failing with complex configurations. Let's use the simplest possible approach:

## Step 1: Remove vercel.json completely

1. Go to your GitHub HolyCrosserMobile repository
2. Delete the `vercel.json` file entirely
3. Commit the deletion

## Step 2: Let Vercel auto-detect everything

1. Import your repository to Vercel again (or redeploy)
2. When Vercel asks for configuration, use these exact settings:

**Project Settings:**
- Framework Preset: **Vite**
- Root Directory: `./`
- Build Command: `vite build`
- Output Directory: `dist`
- Install Command: `npm install`

## Step 3: Override the build command

Since your project has a custom structure, override with:
- Build Command: `npm run build:client`
- Output Directory: `client/dist`

## Why this works:

- No complex routing configurations
- No serverless function conflicts
- Vercel treats it as a standard Vite React app
- Build process is straightforward
- Users get immediate access to the app

## Result:

Your Holy Crosser React app will deploy as a static site. The API calls will fail initially, but users can access the interface and navigation immediately.

This gets your users back online in the next 5 minutes.
