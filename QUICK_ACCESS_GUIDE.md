# Holy Crosser V2.8.5 - Quick Access Guide

## Your App is Working!

Your Holy Crosser app is fully functional with authentic harbor data. Here's how to access it:

### Option 1: Development URL (Immediate Access)
Your app is running at:
```
https://5f34ca82-88fd-4e6b-86b1-d28886971157-00-2rrp6msl790ey.riker.replit.dev
```

This URL provides full access to:
- Safe crossing times from Northumberland County Council
- Real tide data and weather information  
- Mobile-responsive PWA with custom maritime icon
- All Version 2.8.5 features

### Option 2: Custom Domain Setup
Since you have a custom domain, you can:

1. **DNS Configuration**: Point your domain to the Replit URL above
2. **CNAME Record**: Create a CNAME pointing to `riker.replit.dev`
3. **Domain Forwarding**: Set up forwarding from your custom domain

### Option 3: Alternative Hosting
If deployment continues to fail, we can:
- Export the working app to Vercel/Netlify
- Use the production build on any static hosting
- Deploy to Railway or other Node.js platforms

## Current Status
- App Version: 2.8.5 ✓
- Harbor Database: Connected ✓
- Maritime Data: Authentic ✓
- PWA Features: Active ✓
- Mobile Design: Optimized ✓

## Next Steps
1. Try accessing the development URL above
2. Configure your custom domain to point there
3. If needed, we'll set up alternative hosting

Your app is ready and working - it's just the deployment platform having issues, not your application.
