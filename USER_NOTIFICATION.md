# Holy Crosser - Service Update

Dear Holy Crosser Users,

Due to hosting platform infrastructure changes, the app is temporarily accessible at a new URL:

**New Access Link:**
https://5f34ca82-88fd-4e6b-86b1-d28886971157-00-2rrp6msl790ey.riker.replit.dev

**What This Means:**
- All your maritime crossing data is safe and accessible
- Authentic tide times and weather data continue to update
- Your PWA installation and bookmarks work normally
- No data has been lost

**For Mobile Users:**
- Bookmark the new URL
- Your PWA installation will continue working once you visit the new link
- All offline features remain functional

**Next Steps:**
We're working to restore the original URL. In the meantime, please use the link above for uninterrupted access to:
- Safe crossing times from Northumberland County Council
- Real-time tide and weather data
- Your maritime navigation features

Thank you for your patience.
