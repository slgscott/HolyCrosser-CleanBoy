# Simple Vercel Deployment Solution

The build failures are happening because we're trying to force your Express server into Vercel's serverless model. Here's the immediate working solution:

## Replace your GitHub vercel.json with this:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/static-build",
      "config": {
        "buildCommand": "npm run build:client",
        "outputDirectory": "client/dist"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Vercel Project Settings:
- Framework Preset: **Other** 
- Build Command: **npm run build:client**
- Output Directory: **client/dist**

## Deploy as Static Site First

This will deploy your React frontend as a static site immediately. Your users can access the app right away, even if the API calls don't work initially.

## After Static Deploy Works:

We can then add a simple serverless function for the API endpoints if needed. But the priority is getting your users back online.

This approach:
1. ✅ Deploys immediately without configuration conflicts
2. ✅ Serves your React app to users  
3. ✅ Restores user access quickly
4. ⚠️ API calls will fail (can be added later)

The static deployment will give you a working Holy Crosser app that users can access while we solve the API integration.
