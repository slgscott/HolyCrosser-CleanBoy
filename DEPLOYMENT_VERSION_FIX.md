# Version 2.9.1 Deployment Fix

## Issue
Vercel is still showing version 2.9.0 despite local changes showing 2.9.1.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Manual File Upload to Vercel
1. Download/copy the updated `api/health.js` file with version 2.9.1
2. Use Vercel's direct file upload feature if available
3. Or create a new deployment from a different source

### Option 2: Check Vercel Repository Connection
1. Go to Vercel dashboard → Project Settings → Git
2. Verify it's connected to the correct repository and branch
3. Check if there are any sync issues

### Option 3: Force Redeploy with Environment Variable
1. In Vercel dashboard → Project Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add a new variable like `FORCE_DEPLOY=true`
3. Trigger redeploy - this forces a complete rebuild

### Option 4: Create New Branch and Deploy
1. Create a new branch with version 2.9.1 changes
2. Connect Vercel to deploy from that branch
3. This bypasses any main branch issues

## Current Status
- Local files show version 2.9.1 correctly
- Vercel deployment shows version 2.9.0
- GitHub repository access seems limited

## Recommended Action
Try Option 3 (Environment Variable) first, then Option 2 (check Git connection).
