# Mobile White Screen Fix - V2.9.3

## Issues Fixed

### PWA Configuration
- Updated manifest.json version to 2.9.3
- Fixed service worker cache versions to match current release
- Corrected icon file references in service worker
- Added proper service worker registration in HTML

### Mobile Viewport
- Changed viewport from `maximum-scale=1` to `maximum-scale=5.0, user-scalable=yes`
- This prevents iOS from blocking the app due to overly restrictive scaling

### Service Worker Cache
- Updated cache names from v2.4.0 to v2.9.3
- Fixed static file references to match actual files
- Removed references to non-existent SVG files

## Files Modified
- `client/public/manifest.json` - Version update and icon fixes
- `client/public/sw.js` - Cache version and file reference fixes  
- `client/index.html` - Viewport and service worker improvements

## Testing
The build completes successfully and the app should now load properly on mobile devices without white screen issues.

## Next Steps
1. Push changes to GitHub
2. Redeploy on Vercel
3. Test on mobile device
4. Clear browser cache if needed
